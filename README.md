# CAS FEE // Project 2

## 🔥 What's hot
#### Progressive Web App
Wettemer🄬 was developed **mobile first** with a fluid design. It updates **real-time** without you having to reload the site even once. 
Most features that Wettemer🄬 offers are also available **offline**.

#### Latest and newest front end technology
* The latest and fastest ReactJS 16.2
* MaterialUI next
* Not a single line of CSS. It's pure JS.
* Using latest JavaScript features thanks to Babel

## ☔ What's not
* Using beta software (Firestore, Firebase Functions, Material UI) took a lot of time and effort. Even though we learned a lot :)
* React is awesome and fun, but there are too many add-on libraries to choose from. That takes a lot of time just for research.
* During the CAS FEE only little practical knowledge on how to build **real react apps** (not counters) was given.
* Real-time and offline is awesome. But there's no such thing as a free lunch -> `devtime++`
* We are no designers
