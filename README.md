# CAS FEE // Project 2

## 🔥 What's hot
#### Progressive Web App
Wettemer🄬 was developed **mobile first** with a fluid design. It updates **real-time** without you having to reload the site even once. 
Most features that Wettemer🄬 offers are also available **offline**.

#### Latest and newest front end technology
* The latest and fastest ReactJS 16.2
* MaterialUI next
* Not a single line of CSS. It's pure JS.
* Using latest JavaScript features thanks to Babel

## ☔ What's not
* Using beta software (Firestore, Firebase Functions, Material UI) took a lot of time and effort. Even though we learned a lot :)
* React is awesome and fun, but there are too many add-on libraries to choose from. That takes a lot of time just for research.
* During the CAS FEE only little practical knowledge on how to build **real react apps** (not counters) was given.
* Real-time and offline is awesome. But there's no such thing as a free lunch -> `devtime++`
* We are no designers

## 💻 Browser Support
Wettemer was tested on all major browsers:
* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Edge
* Internet Explorer

## 👩‍💻 User Testing
The App was tested by three users (two female, one male). The users were given no specific task, nor a description of the app.
They received the URL with the words: "this is pretty dope. check it out!"

Results were:

### Positive
* the app is almost self explaining and very intuitive
* they liked the app
* offline and real time features impressed

### Room for Improvement
* more features were requested
* the determination who has won a bet should be improved
* adding users is hart, cause the exact email has to be entered
* add button not always perfectly visible on mobile
* make it an app (by adding site to home screen) should be more advertised
